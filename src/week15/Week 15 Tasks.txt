Exceptions Practice [1hr]

Create a class NonResidentException
    make this a unchecked exception

    create a constructor to accept the String argument and pass it to the super constructor

 Create a class FailToCheckOutException
    make this a checked exception

    create a constructor to accept the String argument and pass it to the super constructor

Create a class Library

    create a method getLibraryCard(String city)

        if the city is Fairfax or McLean print Library Card Created

        but if it is any other city throw your NonResidentException
            -> give a message in the constructor call

    create a method borrow(boolean checkedOut)

        if the given checkedOut boolean is true print "Enjoy reading"

        but if the boolean is false throw your FailToCheckOutException

        -> handle this exception in the runner file

Create a class to run the code by calling the methods and seeing the result with different inputs to see how the exceptions were related to the execution

Git Practice - Branch Strategy / Team Collaboration [2hr]

    I will create a new project and invite 2 students to the project. We will take turns screen-sharing and going through a workflow.
    As we go through the flow I will guide you through the steps so others can do it and so we can see which steps you would repeat

Steps to repeat:

    create/update your local feature branch from local develop
    make changes in your local feature branch
    commit and push to your origin feature branch
    make a PR (from origin feature to origin develop) and assign someone on the team

    a team member will look at PR and discuss anything needed
    when changes are good approve the merge
    team updates project

    when sprint ends PR origin develop to origin master
    the team would update master branches too
