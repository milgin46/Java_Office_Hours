T1ColorPicker [loop, Scanner, String]

    Create a program that will allow the user to select three unique colors.
    Ask the user to enter their colors one at a time. Verify the color hasn't been selected already. If the color is unique add it to the final selection otherwise tell the user the colors should be unique and allow them to reenter a different color. The number of iterations is not fixed

    Ex flow:
        Enter color 1:
            > red
        red added
        Enter color 2:
            > red
        red is already selected
        Enter color 2:
            > green
        green added
        Enter color 3:
            > red
        red is already selected
        Enter color 3:
            > green
        green is already selected
        Enter color 3:
            > orange
        orange added

T4Recipe [object type]

    Create a class called Recipe
    declare these instance variables:
        name, ingredients, serving size, cost

    create a setInfo() method to initialize these variables

    create a method called costPerPerson that will return a double. Calculate the amount each person would need to pay to make this recipe - use the serving size and cost values

    create a toString() that shows the information in the following format:
        Recipe for $name will require these ingredients:
                $all_ingredients
        This dish will serve $serving_size and cost a total of $ $cost to make

    create a class called ObjectTester and create some Recipe objects

    Create a class called SportsTeam
    declare these instance variables:
        name, number of players, coach, win/loss record, country, number of fans
